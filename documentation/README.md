# 2 Demonstrations

## 2.1 Demo1

This script produces six kinds of transformations on LFW faces at a resolution of 200x200. Images will be automatically downloaded.

## 2.2 Demo2

This script ages or adds facial hair to a front-facing portrait at resolutions up to 1000x1000. Follow the directions in [datasets/facemodel/sources.txt](../datasets/facemodel/sources.txt) to prepare the image database. 

## 2.3 Demo3

This script fills in missing portions of shoe images. You will need to acquire the [UT Zappos50K](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/finegrained/utzap50k/) images.

# 3 Options

## 3.1 Reconstruction backend (--backend)

We have two backends. Caffe+SciPy uses Caffe to forward/backward VGG
(GPU) then uses SciPy to call the FORTRAN implementation of L-BFGS-B
(CPU). Torch uses PyTorch to do the entire reconstruction on the
GPU. Torch is faster than Caffe+SciPy but it produces a lower-quality
result. We set Caffe+SciPy to be default for the LFW and UT-Zappos50K
demonstrations and Torch to be the default for the high-res face
demonstration.
